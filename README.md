Swallow Stars

Swallow Stars is a terminal-based arcade game built using C++ and the ncurses library. It features dynamic gameplay, collision detection, and real-time rendering directly in the command line interface.

This project was developed to master low-level programming logic, memory management, and game loop architecture in a Unix environment.
